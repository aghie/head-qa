HEAD-QA is a multi-choice ***HEA***lthcare ***D***ataset. The questions come from exams to access a specialized position in the Spanish healthcare system, and are challenging even for highly specialized humans. They are designed by the [Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/), who also provides direct [access](https://fse.mscbs.gob.es/fseweb/view/public/datosanteriores/cuadernosExamen/busquedaConvocatoria.xhtml) to the exams of the last 5 years (in Spanish).
